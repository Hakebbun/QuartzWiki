General:
	A native to [[Latres]] whose family wanted to escape the land stealing cycle because of the impact on their animals. They moved out towards the outskirts of the fertile areas where they could more easily settle, but their finances and crop quality were both impacted.
	Nadine now grows carrots, rutabega, and potatoes with her family. She brings them off to the undercities of Sysam to sell them off.

Ideal:
	I am extremely loyal to those whom I value

Flaw:
	I am stubborn and single minded. 
	I I will protect the individuals I care about at the expense of a larger community

Bonds:
	A greedy family expanded their land into the family's old land. I suspect this development resulted in the destruction of a local bear's den. I tracked them down to the markets in Sysam and set up my stall next to them. Our vegetables always outsell theirs - i take care to cultivate them with druidic magic, but I keep that a secret from them
