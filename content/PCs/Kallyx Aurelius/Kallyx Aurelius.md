Ideals: 
- Craftsmanship,
- Skill is innate and inherent 
- Values family and secrecy
- Believes that the true value of a thing should not be understated =(refuses to scam/offended by the idea of scams)

Flaws: 
- Judgemental of simple things, 
- Blas√© of learned trained skills/studies, 
- Protective of family traditions. 
- Has never left [[Unora]], possibly sheltered?

E.G.
- Saw scammers, used intimidation and persuation to get them to pay 
- Family has been stolen from before

Goals:
- Forge a magic weapon worthy of the family name (Epic)
	- Basic components to be found in Sysam (Short/Med)
	- Rumours of an incredibly rare component lost to the Sobtre isles (Long)
- Find a party to travel with. Has never left [[Unora]] before, so would be valuable to have a group to travel with

Bonds: 
- I've heard a rumour that the University is up to something unsavoury/maybe fraud related. Further evidence of this may lead to major consequences for the otherwise peerless school.
- The Aurelius family has hired a Ronin ([[Mr Bun]]) to find an heirloom amulet that was stolen
