General:
- A Ronin and ex-soldier, Mr Bun refused to follow a particular order from a superior officer. Now marked as a deserter, he wanders the continent. Mr Bun takes odd jobs but refuses distasteful ones. He feels hollow; making just enough money to get by.

Ideals:
- I am free, and will follow my own path

Flaws:
- I am aimless and feel I do not have a purpose

Goals:
- Find purpose (Epic)
- Find the next job (Short)
- Atone for the past (Medium)
- Build a home worth settling into (Long)

Bonds:
- Cinna, a fellow soldier and former friend was given the same order, but followed through with it.
- [[Kallyx Aurelius]]'s family hired Mr Bun to track down a missing amulet. They believe it to be stolen
- A street urchin, [[Balthier of Sysam]], attempted to pickpocket Mr Bun. The urchin earned more bruises than copper, but wasn't worth chasing beyond that.
