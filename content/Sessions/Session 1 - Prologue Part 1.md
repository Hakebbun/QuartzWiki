*An indeterminate distance off the sword coast of Faerun, is the mysterious land mass known only to its residents as The Continent. Its history is defined by an age of conflict, with the great nations Unora, Carados and Latres fighting over the rare and mysterious resource known as Kallite. 

*Our story begins after a century of peace, with 5 individuals setting off to find their place on the Continent*.

*It pays though, to be wary even without the smoke on the horizon. After all, a century of peace to some, is a century of planning to others.*

**Balthier of Sysam**
[[Balthier of Sysam]] stalks his prey. Following his mark through the clothing district of the lower city, Balthier makes use of his preparation and streetwise tactics to successfully lift a purse from the man, leaving him with a bag of rocks to pay for his lower-city clothes.

However, upon returning to his hideout, Balthier encounters [[The Guard Captain]] having broken into his hideout. [[The Guard Captain]] claims that he's been watching the "Little Knife" for a while, and takes Balthiers amulet and cloak. In exchange for the return of these two items, [[The Guard Captain]] demands that Balthier go to Checkpoint 2 and return with the largest Daikon he can find. He also shows off a weapon that seems to transform at will.

Balthier agrees, and attempts to steal back the bag that holds his possessions as The Guard Captain leaves his hideout. He succeeds in lifting the bag, but magical protection burns Balthier's hand, and he's unable to regain his things. Despite this, he's sure that without that protection magic, he could lift from the Guard Captain. If only there were a way to bypass that magic...

Balthier finds himself in Checkpoint 2 and sucessfully lifts a large Daikon from Lenny Ficklerunt before the Skirmish at Checkpoint 2

**Stratus**
[[Cirrostratus Aurora]] wraps up her daily work in the fields to find her parents running an event they call "Collection Day" - a time where they can embarrass themselves in exchange for donations of money and crops from their neighbours. 

The Aurora parents claim that this is to raise enough money for Stratus to make tuition for another semester. Her father seems incredibly distraught, and her mother mostly keeping it together. Her Father convinces Stratus to take the goods that he's collected via collection day and sell it in Checkpoint 2 to make some money to go towards her next term's tuition.

They are suspicious of the "romantic relationship that caused Stratus to leave the University" but they do not have details. Her father gives her a patch to show vendors in Checkpoint 2, claiming that showing it to vendors may get her a discount. The patch is an image of 2 check marks, with the second one pierced by an arrow

Stratus makes her way towards Checkpoint 2 with the intention of selling the goods from collection day.

**Kallyx**
[[Kallyx Aurelius]] sips wine in her room in Unora as her day ends. She's interrupted by her father, nudging that his "little jewel" should make her way out of Unora and begin her own quest to make her namesake weapon forging. He reminds her that she'll need an arcane focus, which she can realistically find anywhere, but she should go to the Sysam lower city to trade for some base materials. He doesn't seem worried about her, as the trip to Sysam is not uncommon.

Her Mother requests that her Father leave to have a private conversation with Kallyx. She requests that Kallyx ignore the rumour that she had heard of a powerful arcane focus that could be found on the Sobtre isles. She encouraged Kallyx to give up on forging anything incredible, by seeking out a powerful focus, instead she should just forge anything at all.

She notes that she has already hired a bodyguard for her to go to Sysam, and sends Kallyx on her way.

**Mr Bun**
[[Mr Bun]] finds himself on a Kallyx's caravan travelling to Checkpoint 2. He makes the 18 hour trip alongside an overly talkative caravan driver who complains about constantly having to follow the whims of "spoiled princelings". 

The caravan driver tries to pry Mr Bun's pay amount for protecting Kallyx from him, but Mr Bun keeps his cards close to the chest. The Driver then pivots his strategy, offering that his employer, whoever they are, has offered to pay a significant amount for him to arrive at Checkpoint 2, and allow "whatever it is that will happen, to happen". He seems pretty jazzed about this, since either he gets paid by House Aurelius, or he gets paid by his mysterious employer.

[[Mr Bun]], ever the honourable bunny, communicates this to Kallyx in warning that something is going to go down and that her safety is likely to be in question. The driver hands Mr Bun a note with 2 checkmarks - the second mark being pierced by an arrow, as something that his employer gave him as a signal for whatever is about to happen. He surmises that this indicates something is supposed to happen at Checkpoint 2.

**Orsa**
Orsa finds herself in Checkpoint 2 selling her carrots. She meets a few customers who pay regular prices for a few of her giant carrots, but notices that Lenny's booth is doing abnormally well today.

She eavesdrops on one of his conversations and notices that Lenny seems to be giving away his largest Daikon for free. This happens a number of times before a hooded figure approaches Orsa's cart.

The hooded figure offers a massive sum of gold to Orsa for her to step away from her cart for a while, presumably so he can have a conversation with Lenny. Orsa, offended by the offer, refuses. The hooded figure leaves her alone, and indicates to Lenny that something big will he happening soon.

**Skirmish at Checkpoint 2**
A lone arrow is fired from a tower connected to the walls to the lower city, and from that arrow, Shady, a woman with magical power appears. She calls forth a number of thieves and dretches, along with a conspirator, Meanie, and sends her minions to begin stealing the daikon and Kallite lined equipment found on Kallyx's caravan.

The party fends off the attack, but Shady gets away with a few of the largest daikon. Meanie, left behind, is ripped apart by the party, a small version of himself pulled from his dretch-spawning body and is being cared for by Orsa.

After the skirmish, The Guard Captain bars the party from entering Sysam, saying they must find him those responsible for the attack, or take the blame themselves.
