*An indeterminate distance off the sword coast of Faerun, is the mysterious land mass known only to its residents as The Continent. Its history is defined by an age of conflict, with the great nations Unora, Carados and Latres fighting over the rare and mysterious resource known as Kallite. 

*Our story begins after a century of peace, with 5 individuals setting off to find their place on the Continent*.

*It pays though, to be wary even without the smoke on the horizon. After all, a century of peace to some, is a century of planning to others.*
