**Scheduling**
- Prefer in person but open to virtual if not possible
- Book days everyone is available, but consider switch to virtual closer if things change
- Book each session at the end of a previous one. 
	- try to book 2
- Aim for every 2-3 weeks, but we’ll do our best

**At the table**
- Make sure we bring non alcoholic
- Setup a hangout start time and a gameplay start time separately
- Figure out food and snacks and drinks in advance
	- circulate who’s bringing food/drinks each session
	- help with suggestions beforehand

**Safety Tools**

**In Game** 
- Disliked tropes:

	- “forced romantic entanglement” “it’s not a dating sim”
	- don’t like full grim dank

- Would like to see
	- Generally interested in puzzles!

	- Deadliness aiming for about 50% for the campaign? Balance is hard though, we'll see
	- Aim to have narratively lead deaths 
	- There exists in-world resurrection

- Etc
	- Somatic/verbal matters, but don't track components
	- Money matters
