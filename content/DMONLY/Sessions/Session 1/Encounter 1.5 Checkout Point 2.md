Everyone should be in Checkpoint 2, let's see what the players are interested in

Magic Shop
- For Sale:
	- Light healing salves (2d4 healing, bonus action) 50gp
	- Potion of Poison resistance (advantage on poison related saving throws for 1 hour) 50gp
	- Scroll of Illusory Script (1 use) 50gp
	- Scroll of Feather Fall (1 use) 50gp
- Made the trip from Carados
	- A volunteer from near the University. They get a cut of the profits for selling off the goods for the lower-ranked students.
	- Still risk involved though. They need to make enough to hire a guard to get them back to the University
	- Especially now. More monsters on the roads these days

Weapon shop:
- For Sale
	- Sickles (1gp), Handaxes (5gp), and shortbows (25gp)
	- Prices as in book
- Came from Unora
	- a lesser smith, mostly here to sell wares to latresian farmers
	- Damn taxes make it near impossible to turn a profit for a lower house that only makes tools and basics.
	- At least Unoran roads are mostly safe.
		- Though, maybe the price isn't worth it...
		- More guards means more corrupt guards. And for low houses that means mugging under the guise of taxing. Corruption's been getting worse and worse these days...

Food Stalls
- For Sale: 
	- Food and snacks for pittance
	- Oil 5gp (ignites for 5 bonus fire damage. Lasts on a space for 2 rounds, can also use to slick the ground, DC10 dex or fall)
- Latresian merchant super stoked, vegetables have been going really well
	- Used to be a 2 person game, but the little guys are coming up HUUGE
	- Saw some shady dude by the toilets, that was weird.


Poisoner behind the latrines:
- For Sale:
	- Needs to be persuaded to deal with at all
	- Poison, Basic (100gp), next damaging attack deals additional 1d4. Applies 3 times for ranged weapons.
	- Potion of Poison resistance (advantage on poison related saving throws for 1 hour) 25gp
	- Poison, slow acting (25gp). Sour smelling, clear liquid. 15 minutes after ingestion,  Target has the poisoned condition for 1 hour. (disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks)
- Sysam resident, claims to be well connected amongst the undercity guilds but no strict allegiance. Used to study at the University, but can't afford his next tuition payment. Left years ago
- There's been more squabbles between guilds lately. Something big is happening, but nobody will tell him what. No matter, good business for a poisoner with business sense.
