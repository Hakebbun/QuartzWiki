*An indeterminate distance off the sword coast of Faerun, is the mysterious land mass known only to its residents as The Continent. Its history is defined by an age of conflict, with the great nations Unora, Carados and Latres fighting over the rare and mysterious resource known as Kallite. 

*Our story begins after a century of peace, with 5 individuals setting off to find their place on the Continent*.

*It pays though, to be wary even without the smoke on the horizon. After all, a century of peace to some, is a century of planning to others.*

**Kallyx** - She's in Unora working on a project. Parents approach her to discuss her plans.
- Maybe I should write a description of her room? Or the general vibe as the scene opens
- I think they're encouraging because they want her to get out and see the world, but they're worried because she never has before
- do I want to intro that Mr Bun is going to be hired for this as well? Would be good to do this one BEFORE Mr Bun
- Need character info for the parents
	- I like the characters calling her Jewel or something

**Mr Bun**- Ideally I seed this to be post Kallyx. 
- Scene takes place on a caravan. He rides at the front with the driver. 
- Say he's been hired on as a bodyguard, but want to drop that another party is paying way more  to ensure that the shipment makes it into Sysam. 
	- Probably Mr Bun won't bite, since he holds morals over money
	- Maybe drop that Cinna is in Sysam? Because there aren't many lapins?
- "2 birds with one stone. If one of those birds was made of pure Kallite"
- Can I drop that [[the Commander]] is in Sysam? 
	- How does this rando know?
	- Maybe it should be 
		- Connection to something Mr Bun wears?

**Balthier** - in medias res, he's actively following a mark
- Simple check to pickpocket the guy, like DC7, i want a success for 2 gold
- Head back to where he's staying to find it ransacked or something
- Guard threatens and needs to convince Balthier to take on a bigger job, steal something from the caravans arriving today
	- What does he need to steal? How tightly do I want to tie?
- Can he take one of the heirlooms?
- Need a statblock for this guard guy

**Nadine** - Open on the vegetable stand outside Checkpoint 2
- Neighbour is conspicuously late this time around
- A few customers come by
- Neighbour arrives
	- Banter?
	- Can notice that the neighbour is doing exceptionally well today
- Shady customer
	- DC 10 eavesdrop for the full conversation
	- Signals something to the neighbour that it's time to leave
	- Neighbour complains
	- Shady blames him for being late

**Stratus** - Collection day!
- Stratus's parents degrading themselves to get donations from other farmstead members
	- They want her to get back to the University as soon as she can
	- They don't know why she left, but they know it's because of the end of a relationship
		- They assume her privacy about the matter is because it's awkward sex stuff
	- They're unendingly giving and are not embarassed at all to do anything to get more collection
		- Maybe they set up a dunk tank or something
- Stratus's parents need to give her a charm before sending her off to sell the collection




Montage ends with everybody passing through Checkpoint 1 without issue, but getting blocked at Checkpoint 2
