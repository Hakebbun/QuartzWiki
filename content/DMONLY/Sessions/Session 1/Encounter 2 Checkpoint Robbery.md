Several parked caravans are awaiting inspection at Checkpoint 2. The road is lined with stalls - vendors

Spellcaster creates an area of darkness around herself, DC 10 Arcana to know that you can't shoot projectiles into it

Shady
Meanie: Needs a statblock - fears the animals (makes the move closer to the darkness)
Spawn 2 Acolytes inside the darkness
Spawn 4 Dretch (from the Daikon)
Spawn 6 Runners they try to get to and from the caravans

Wincon - kill all the runners/kill 

Dretches always attack whatever is closest
Acolytes fight like humans (attack high-threat ranged)
Runners:
- Bounce between caravan and Shady, each has 6hp, and always fail saves
Shady:
- maintains Darkness until somebody crosses into it,
- then casts haste on runners if somebody is in darkness (Let's get out of here quickly)
- If she's below 50% hp, she hastes herself and goes for the nearest runner/caravan
Meanie: 
- First turn fears the horses 
- If took damage, uses mitosis bomb
- if did not take damage, uses mitosis spawn
