_There are 3 ways to tell that you're facing a Mage from Carados: their differently colored eyes, their incredible magic potential, and most importantly, their impeccable fashion sense._

On the southern tip of the Continent is the nation of Carados, known for its unique fashion, and the Continent-renowned University. Carados colors are Blue, Black, and White.

Despite a deeply engrained culture of individualism and self-making, outside of the University, non-students benefit from a deeply generous social welfare system. There hasn't been a hungry person in the nation since the University's inception.

Once a student enrolls however, they are no longer allowed to access the same systems and must provide for themselves, either purchasing their needs from the University itself or venturing off elsewhere in the continent between semesters. 

In fact, tuition (known as "donation" in the University) becomes incredibly steep the moment a student is enrolled. An initial donation is required to interview for a position as a student to begin with, then future donations must be made at the beginning of each semester. The amount of required donation is decreased for those with outstanding individual performance in their studies, but for those at the bottoms of the rankings it is not uncommon to go on multi-year hiatuses to save up enough to continue their studies. 

Graduates then, are exceedingly rare in the continent and can be classified as one of two specialties:  
  
Scholars are inventors, lawmakers, and leaders. Never-ending torches, staves emitting flames, and shields that attract missiles are just a few devices that have come from the University and have found their way across the continent. Scholars seek to develop ever more useful tools and gain greater understanding of the history of the Continent itself. They are recognizable by their fully-blue right eye.

Archmages are a combination of the nation's military, bodyguards, and explorers. They are even rarer than Scholars and only a single Archmage graduates every few years. They are recognizable by their pure-black left eye

With a nation of people whose daily needs are met combined with a group of brilliant minds trying to prove their strong individualism gave way for artistic trades to flourish in an incredible way. Specifically, the tailors of Carados are known Continent-wide for their skill and precision. Any article of clothing dreamed up by the voraciously individualistic students at the University can be made into reality through the skills of these tradespeople. As a result, of this combination, it would be equal parts incredibly rare and embarassing for a Caradosi student to be wearing an identical piece of clothing to another, indicating a lack of individualist creativity.

[[Kallite]] is used in Carados as the primary payment method in the University (where it is either turned into magical tools by prospective scholars or traded for goods and distributed amongst the nation's people). It is also refined into the mysterious substance known as "Drops". Blue or Black paste pressed into the eyes of Caradosi that temporarily augments their skills
